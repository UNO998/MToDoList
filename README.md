## Running the application locally

One way is to execute the `main` method from your IDE.

- Download the zip or clone the Git repository.
- Unzip the zip file (if you downloaded one)
- Open Command Prompt and Change directory (cd) to folder containing pom.xml
- Open Eclipse 
   - File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the zip
   - Select the project
- Choose the Spring Boot Application file (search for @SpringBootApplication)
- Right Click on the file and Run as Java Application

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Security

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
